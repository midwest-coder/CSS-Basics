# CSS-Basics
In this repository we talk about css, the language used to style your website. Where HTML is called the 'content layer' of a website, CSS is called the 'presentation layer'. 
That means that css is capable of changing the colors, positioning, size, and even animations of our HTML elements. There are many more features to css beyond these basic ones, but those will be for a more advanced lesson.
